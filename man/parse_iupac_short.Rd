A glycan graph if \code{x} is a single character,
or a list of glycan graphs if \code{x} is a character vector.

\details{
The IUPAC-short notation is a compact form of IUPAC-condensed notation.
It is rarely used in database, but appears a lot in literature for its
conciseness. Compared with IUPAC-condensed notation, IUPAC-short notation
ignore the anomer positions, assuming they are known for common monosaccharides.
For example, "Neu5Aca3Gala-" assumes the anomer of Neu5Ac is C2 (a2-3 linked).
Also, the parentheses around linkages are omitted, and parentheses are used
to indicate branching, e.g. "Neu5Aca3Gala3(Fuca3)GlcNAcb-".

Same as IUPAC-condensed notation, the reducing-end monosaccharide can be with
or without anomer information. For example, the two strings below are all valid:
\itemize{
\item "Neu5Aca-"
\item "Neu5Ac"
}

In the first case, the anomer is "a2". In the second case, the anomer is "?2".
